### Overall Goals
* Create an e-commerce cloud-hosted Full-Stack web application to sell dental products online.
* Allow superusers access to full CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality on reviews / articles and products respectively.
* To provide users with a targeted product selection and smooth customer experience when shopping with Exclusive Whitnening.

### Strategy
* Exclusive Whitnening is focused on selling B2C products to end users. Habits of the consumers have changed recently and many more consumers than ever before have turned to home whitening versus in office whitening procedures. This is where Exclusive Whitnening aims to benefit consumers by offering large discounts on the whitening paraphernalia.

### Site User / Target Audience / Demographic
* Target market is aimed at anyone old enough to use the products.
* People who may have stained teeth. eg Smokers, Coffee Drinkers
* People who are interested in dental articles.

### Site Goals
* The site's main purpose is immediately clear
* Simple navigation that allows the user to find information and resources intuitively
* User authentication
* CRUD functionality for superuser(s)

## Design 

## Web Marketing / Marketing Strategies
### SEO
Google keyword research was used to optimise web pages and content to increase ranking in search engines. Both short-tail & Long-tail keywords are used. The “People also ask” and “Related searches” was also used to identify keywords used.

### Content Marketing
A blog post was created so that the website can create and distribute content material to attract and convert audience into first time customers and repeat customers. The main aim of the blog posts is to build trust and loyalty.

### Social Media Marketing
A Facebook business page was set up with the aim of generating growth organically by building a community and encouraging loyalty amongst our target market. The advantage of this is its free and quick to set up and Facebook has a large audience and demographic. The site can connect with customers directly via the Facebook platform and wider global audience. The main aim of the Facebook page is to build and maintain relationship with target audience. Content created can be spread across different social media platforms.

### Email Marketing
Mailchimp is used to gain new customers and retain existing. Mailchimp enables the business to run and analyse the success of newsletter marketing campaigns. Users who register to receive the newsletter are automatically added to weekly newsletter. This strategy was chosen because its free to set up with the current level of business and can scale quickly as the business grows therefore increase conversions and generate more revenue for the business. The users who sign up have already visited the website and are more likely to become customers and therefore low cost to generate sales.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
